# Changelog

All notable changes to the project will be documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.0.0/),
and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

To release a new version copy the `unreleased` section below tagging it with the version number,  
including the link to it and the release date, then create a new `unreleased` section with empty  
paragraphs for added, changed, removed and maintenance.
Open PR and, once approved and merged, pull `master` and tag the release version with:

```shell
git tag -a <version>
git push <version>
```
